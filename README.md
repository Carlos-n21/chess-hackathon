## Introduction

This website was created as part of the WECA group Hackathon, to finalize the Full Stack Web Development with AI.<br>
Initial idea came from one of the members that wnated to do this project, but with more features that sounded too much for this project, as it was only 4 working days long, <br>and the group felt it was better to achieve a working MVP with basic features that our colleague can use in the future as a base for own project and get more advanced features or redo it.
